Investigative focus: How AI will reshape Canadian labour markets

Dataset: Canadian wages datasets (2012–2024)

Objective:

You are working with Canadian wages datasets available in this workspace. Based on the data, the investigative focus is to explore and present:

• How AI is expected to reshape the job market, by industry and region
• Demographic impacts of AI adoption (e.g., how race, gender, income level, and geography influence access to emerging opportunities)
• Current trends in workforce diversity, wage equity, and skill gaps
• Which groups are most likely to benefit from AI, and which face barriers to participation in the evolving economy

Guidelines and approach suggestions:

- Use the wage datasets from 2012 to 2024 (not all years required) and any supplementary datasets you deem useful (labour force surveys, Census, job posting APIs, occupational task data).
- Explore changes over time by industry and region (province/territory, urban/rural). Identify industries with high automation/AI exposure and those creating new opportunities.
- Analyze demographic differentials (gender, race/ethnicity if available, age, education, income brackets). Note where data gaps exist and propose methods to address them.
- Examine workforce diversity and wage equity trends: compute median wages by group, Gini or Theil indices by subgroup, representation in high-growth occupations.
- Identify skill gaps by comparing required skills (tech, soft skills) vs. current workforce credentials. Suggest reskilling pathways and policy interventions.
- Provide clear visualizations and concise, actionable recommendations for policymakers, educators, businesses, and community groups.

Deliverables:

1. A descriptive summary file `INVESTIGATIVE_FOCUS.md` (this file).
2. Updated `notebook.ipynb` with exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and initial findings.
3. Optional: additional data download scripts or helper modules to fetch supplementary datasets.

Notes:
- If race/ethnicity is not present in datasets, document the gap and propose proxies or complementary sources (e.g., Census data at geographic granularity).
- Be explicit about assumptions (e.g., mapping NAICS to automation exposure) and document all data transformations.
- Where appropriate, provide reproducible code cells in `notebook.ipynb` and brief explanations next to visuals.

End of brief.
